Natural Disaster Management via Blockchain and Data Analytics
Problem:-
The governmental and non-governmental organisations are swift to react when disaster strikes and help the affected nations greatly. But humanitarian efforts are often harmed by a lack of transparency among different relief providers. There can be no doubt that mankind has made amazing progress in terms of disaster aid and relief. With partners from different nations and NGOs joining efforts, it is no longer difficult for one disaster-effected country to get recovered quickly. But operations that are executed by different parties require quick action which offer challenges. There is lack of co-ordination among such organisations and hence this leads to inefficiency. Also, lack of transparency and security in the Quick time-frame of Disaster management is a major concern. There are also relief funds which are donated by various people to these affected areas and it has been seen that there are some frauds involved even in these systems.

Solution:-
Creating trust and Efficiency
The blockchain is able to quickly and easily provide an independent system of record that could be key to providing quicker, more effective help for people affected by an emergency.  Blockchain allows central systems of relief mission participants — for example, the UN, national humanitarian aid, NGOs, and others — to connect via a distributed network.
 For the involved parties, this means:--
Distributed power:-    All parties are equally entitled and can continue to use their own resource planning system.
Partner interoperability:-   The blockchain provides a single source of truth for all operations that are updated in real time. Every party can access the transaction history
Privacy:-  Parties keep their data sovereignty and don’t have to expose their resource capacities to other participants.
Funds Transparency:-   A portal on Blockchain Platform, in which small to big contributors can contribute to the fund with trust established with blockchain, and being, decentralized and blockchain-powered eliminates the fraud and security issues.
Machine Learning:-  Use of Transaction history ( datasets) and feeding them into a machine learning model for future prediction of Resource Allocation and impacts.

Implementation:-

The blockchain will be created on Azure Blockchain WorkBench and by using a smart contract on etheruem framework— a simple, open algorithm embedded in the blockchain, ensuring that the parties stick to commonly agreed on rules — offers that match requests could automatically be accepted and help could be provided without delay. The history of the transactions would be securely saved to the blockchain. The transactions and data will we stored on Azure Cloud Services for no heavy lifting of data.
The Data Analytics part is done via Azure Analytics and AI services.

Impact:-
Timely and Efficient Resource allocation and hence saving many lives by adequate available Resources. With no intermediate party in Relief funds, it gives full transparency and efficient capital allocation to the affected areas, thus proving economical. Data Analysis using GPS and GIS can help detect organizations affected areas and hence, efficient relief can be carried out and hence saving millions of lives.
